Dear <%= @survey.giver.full_name %>,

Your colleague, <%= @survey.receiver.full_name %>, recently signed up for Ripple: a peer-to-peer networking application empowering co-workers to share authentic and honest feedback with their colleagues. This information is collected through a series of short web-based surveys (Reflection Surveys). A typical survey takes no more than 20-30 seconds to complete. The process is quick, easy, and completely anonymous.

<%= @survey.receiver.first_name %> values your opinion and is interested in getting your feedback.  Would you please complete a Reflection Survey on <%= @survey.receiver.first_name %>? Using the information you provide, <%= @survey.receiver.first_name %> will be better equipped to make meaningful changes in everyday work habits and become a better co-worker. You can see how Ripple works at http://ripplecrew.com.

It’s easy to complete the survey – just paste the link below into your browser.  Oh, and when you’re done with <%= @survey.receiver.first_name %>'s survey, you can sign up and start requesting feedback from others too!  (Don’t worry - it’s quick and easy to request feedback.  Ripple will guide you through the process.)
