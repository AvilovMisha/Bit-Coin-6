Dear <%= @user.first_name %>, 

I have recently signed up to use Ripple: a peer-to-peer networking application that empowers people to become more self-aware by sharing authentic and honest feedback with their colleagues.

This information is collected through a series of short, web-based surveys (Reflection Surveys). The process is quick and completely anonymous. A group of people at<%= company_name %> have been chosen to participate in a free trial of Ripple. My goal is to better understand how I am perceived by my coworkers. I'd like you to participate in this project by giving me feedback through Ripple.

At the beginning of the trial program, you (and the other participants I have invited from<%= company_name %>) will each complete a 50-question Reflection Survey about me. These are short questions looking for your gut reaction -- don't overthink things. This survey should take you about 5 minutes to complete. At the bottom of the survey you will find a box that you can check if you'd like to provide written comments about any of the specific questions, or any general comments regarding your overall impression of the survey.

After everyone completes the initial 50-question survey, every week you will receive a new, shorter survey. This may be a 5-question Ripple Reflection Survey about me, or a custom survey about<%= company_name %>'s operating principles. These weekly surveys should only take you about 20-30 seconds to complete. Your feedback will provide me invaluable insight and empower me to make appropriate changes in my work habits.

To get started, simply click the link below (you may need to paste it into your browser), choose a password for your Ripple account, and complete the initial 50-question Reflection Survey. Remember, your feedback is completely anonymous.

<% url = edit_user_password_url(@user, reset_password_token: @token, host: @user.host) %>
<%= url %>

If you get interrupted while completing a survey, your responses will be saved. You can always return to the survey by using your email address and password to log back in at www.ripplecrew.com. (Each survey email also has a link that will take you directly to that survey.)

Should you experience any problems or have any questions about Ripple, please email support@ripplecrew.com. A member of the Ripple team will quickly assist you.

Thank you in advance for your participation and your feedback.
