Dear <%= @user.first_name %>, 

You have been chosen to participate in a pilot program using Ripple<%= company_at_name %> to provide feedback for <%= subj_full_name %>.

Ripple improves employee self-awareness by enabling authentic and timely feedback among co-workers via web-based surveys. The goal of this project is to better understand how <%= subj_first_name %> is perceived by colleagues. 

Your feedback for <%= subj_first_name %> will be gathered through two surveys: a standard 50-question Ripple Reflection Survey, and a customized 15-question survey created by<%= company_name %>. The process to complete these surveys is quick and easy. Your feedback will be completely anonymous.

To get started, simply click the link below (you may need to paste it into your browser), choose your account password, and complete your surveys.

<% url = edit_user_password_url(@user, reset_password_token: @token, host: @user.host) %>
<%= url %>

If you get interrupted while completing a survey, your responses will be saved. You can always return to the survey by using your email and password to log back in at www.ripplecrew.com. 

Should you experience any problems or have any questions about Ripple, do not hesitate to email us at support@ripplecrew.com. A member of the Ripple team will quickly assist you.

Thank you,
Ripple Analytics
