Hello <%= @email %>!

Someone just made a request to change your Ripple password. Click the link below to choose a new password.

<%= link_to 'Change my password', edit_user_password_url(@resource, reset_password_token: @token, host: @resource.host) %>

If you didn't request a password reset, you can safely ignore this message.

Your password won't change until you access the link above and create a new one.

If you have any questions or concerns, please send a message to support@ripplecrew.com and we'll be happy to help.
